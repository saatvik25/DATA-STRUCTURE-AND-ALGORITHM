classes -> are basic template for creating objects 
objects -> basic run time entities
encapsulation -> wrapping data and function into single unit
data abstraction -> showing only essential information
inheritance -> properties of one class can inherits into other

dynamic binding -> code which will execute is not known until the program runs 

message passing -> object.messaage(information) call format 
ex obj.func("hello");
